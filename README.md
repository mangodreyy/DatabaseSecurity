# DatabaseSecurity
The project requires expanding the current organisation's database structure and implementing a robust security layer by creating new database objects (tables, views, stored procedures, users) and applying advanced techniques such as Hashing, Encryption, Masking, and auditing to ensure data Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability (CIA).

The entire development, administration, and security implementation process was managed using SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS), without the involvement of any front-end application or client-side code.
